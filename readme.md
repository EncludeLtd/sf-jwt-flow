# Salesforce JWT Bearer Flow Example
This repository is meant to demonstrate how to obtain an access token using Salesforce's OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer (Server-to-Server) Flow.

Code examples are written in JavaScript, but without the use of any library not likely available in all languages so that it might be easily implemented in any language. One possible exception is the [jwt-simple] library, used to create the signed JWT.

## Instructions
